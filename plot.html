      <p>The story is set in an alternate-history late-Edo period, where humanity is attacked by aliens called "Amanto" (天人, "Sky People"). Edo Japan's samurai fights to defend Earth, but the shōgun cowardly surrenders when he realizes the aliens' power. He agrees to an unequal contract with the aliens, placing a ban on carrying swords in public and allowing the invaders to enter the country.

        The samurai's swords are confiscated and the Tokugawa bakufu (shogunate) becomes a puppet government.</p>
    
    <p>The series focuses on an eccentric samurai, Gintoki Sakata who works as an odd-jobs freelancer. He helps a teenager named Shinpachi Shimura save his sister Tae from an alien group that wants to send her to a brothel. Impressed by Gintoki, Shinpachi becomes his freelance apprentice to pay the bills and learn more about the enigmatic samurai. When the pair rescues a teenage alien girl with super-strength, Kagura, from a Yakuza group, they accept her into their freelancing business and the three become known as "Yorozuya" (万事屋, "We do everything" or literally "The Anything Store").

    While working, they regularly encounter the Shinsengumi police force, who often ally with Gintoki when work involves dangerous criminals. The trio also meets Gintoki's former comrades from the Amanto invasion, including the revolutionary Kotaro Katsura who is friendly toward them despite his terrorist activities against the alien-controlled government.

      Although the story is mostly episodic, a few story arcs and recurring antagonists develop.[4] For example, Gintoki's former comrade Shinsuke Takasugi is a major antagonist who regards Gintoki and his other former comrades as enemies and seeks to destroy the shogunate. Over time, Takasugi gains allies, including Kagura's brother Kamui, and the elite fighting unit Mimawarigumi to prepare for his large-scale coup d'état. After the true antagonist—the immortal Utsuro—is introduced, Gintoki works with both friends and enemies to stop Utsuro from destroying the Earth.

      <h3><b>Themes and Style</b></h3>

      <p>
      Hideaki Sorachi's main focus in Gin Tama is the use of gags; during the manga's second year of serialization, he started to add more drama to the story while still keeping the comedy.[5] Various jokes from the manga are comments regarding clichés from other shōnen series. For example, in the first chapter, after Gintoki fights a group of aliens to protect  <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/8baa5bc1-8e90-462d-a884-63dc6f37a765%2Fgintmagroup2.jpg?v=1632956364059" alt="HTML" width="280" height="390" class="flowLeft">Shinpachi and Tae, Shinpachi complains that he only fought for "one page" and Gintoki replies, "Shut up! One page is a long time for a manga artist!" Gintoki's exaggerated desire to read the Weekly Shōnen Jump (which causes him to fight other readers to get it) also makes fun of shōnen, since during those parts characters quote them.[2][6] Other types of comedic situations are more general so that the reader must know about Japanese culture to understand them.[7] The humor is described by publications as being "bizarre" and "weird". It is also described as being divided between two categories: "sci-fi comedy" and a "samurai comedy" with the former referring to the aliens.[8] It tends to point out "an irritating foible about modern society" including celebration days or famous mythical figures.[4] Additionally, there are references to several historical figures with a few characters from the story being based on them.[9] Besides the series' comedy, the aliens' invasion of Japan brings several social issues between them and the humans with the most recurring one being the lack of social equality.[10] As a result, one of the main themes involves society trying to preserve their way of living rather than fulfilling a dream like in other shōnen series.[11]
