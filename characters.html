 is a member of the Yorozuya alongside Sakata Gintoki and Shinpachi Shimura and the main female protagonist of Gintama.
Although she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato people are said to have "transparent" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. </p>

is the famed chain smoking, vice commander of the Shinsengumi so named by his subordinates, because of his fearsome demeanor. Purportedly the brains behind the force, he takes his work seriously, and is fiercely loyal to his leader, Isao Kondo.
Hijikata has a reputation as a fearsome leader, earning the nickname of "demonic vice-commander." He is also hot-tempered and often speaks of seppuku. However, despite his cold exterior, he does have a more compassionate side. He also has a tendency to cry after watching movies that are not particularly emotional.</p>

He wishes to kill Hijikata Toushirou and become the Vice-Commander, the final sword protecting Kondou, of Shinsengumi.</p>

His superior is Matsudaira Katakuriko, a high-ranking government officer under direct control of the Bakufu.
