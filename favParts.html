 It's easy for any anime fan to understand Kagura's plight in "Sleep Helps A Child Grow." Being young, one's mind is always too full of wonder and energy to sleep. It certainly doesn't help that she lives in the Odd Jobs household.
As if the walls and floorboards themselves were conspiring to keep her from sleeping, Kagura has one misadventure after another in her attempt to get some sleep. Fortunately for her, she can always rely on Gintoki to help tuck her in at night. Or, at least, she can force him into</p>

 The odd jobs were trying to help out the barber, as he left to get a manga that he thought he didnt have. The odd jobs were hoping no one would come to the barber shop as they had no idea how to cut other peoples hair. Just as they were hoping that no one was going to come in the barber, a policeman and a joi rebel came in. And just to make matters worst the shogun also took a visit to get his haircut.  </p>
