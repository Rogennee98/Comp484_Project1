    <p>I really love all the episodes in Gintama, especially the ones that are really funny. The anime consistes a range of genres from comedy to action to historcial. It's loads of fun to watch and I never get tired of watching all the episodes for the 5th time. So these are some of my favorite episodes that I found really hilarious and fun to watch.</p>

 The odd jobs were trying to help out the barber, as he left to get a manga that he thought he didnt have. The odd jobs were hoping no one would come to the barber shop as they had no idea how to cut other peoples hair. Just as they were hoping that no one was going to come in the barber, a policeman and a joi rebel came in. And just to make matters worst the shogun also took a visit to get his haircut.  </p>

 There was a virus outbreak in edo. Everyone living in Edo had their hair failling off. As odd jobs were having an exsistencial crisis on how they were going to make up for being bald in the show. They thought that some medicine for hair loss would help with the hair falls but it apparently made that hair loss even worst. So they decided to wear wigs that would go with their character.  </p>
